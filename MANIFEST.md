gr-isdbt is a complete ISDB-T receiver (i.e. from the USRP to the audio/video transport stream). In addition to being capable of producing the multimedia stream, several indicators are available (such as SNR, pre and post viterbi BER, synchronization errors, channel estimate, etc.). More may be obtained by using our other OOT project gr-mer, which calculates several digital modulator indicators (e.g. MER).
